John went to the market to buy ingredients for his new recipe. He asked the butcher for pork belly, but the butcher had none. John went to another market and asked the butcher for pork belly. The butcher said, "We don't have any, you might want to check Mariano's." John went to Mariano's and guess what? He found pork belly! John went to the checkout line, but realized he left his wallet at home. The end.
