John went to the market to buy spices, vegetables and other ingredients for his new recipe. He asked the butcher for pork belly, but the butcher had none. John went to the Meat Packing District and asked the butcher for pork belly. The butcher said, "We don't have any, you might want to check Mariano's on Halsted street." John went to Mariano's and guess what? He found pork belly! John went to the checkout line, but realized he left his wallet at home. Oh crap.
